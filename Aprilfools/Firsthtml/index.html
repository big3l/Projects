                <b>JavaScript</b> is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, 
                imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. <b>JavaScript</b> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),
                [8] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms 
                to the ECMAScript specification. It is a programming language that is characterized as dynamic, 
                weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and CSS, <b>JavaScript</b> is one of
                the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[9] <b>JavaScript</b> enables interactive web pages and is
                an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[10] and major web
                browsers have a dedicated <b>JavaScript</b> engine to execute it. As a multi-paradigm language, 
                <b>JavaScript</b> supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and 
                prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular 
                expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, 
                storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it is embedded to 
                provide these features.

                        <p> <i>Attack of the Killer Potatoes is a 1997 science-fiction children's story by 
                            Peter Lerangis. Its title spoofs the 1978 film, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, 
                            and the film's sequels. The book's tagline reads, "Lock the doors, close the 
                            windows, warn the neighbors...". The book was published by the children's 
                            publishing division of Scholastic Press, Apple Paperback. The story tells of 
                            several potatoes exposed to chemicals. The chemicals cause the potatoes to 
                            rapidly grow in size, become clever and sapient, and begin an attack on humanity. 
                            In essence, the book is a parody of the creature-feature films of the 1950s, 
                            combined with the oddball satire of Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.Reception was 
                            mostly mixed. Critics felt it was a fun but nonsensical children's book.</i>

                            <p> <b>Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is a 1978 musical dark comedy horror film 
                                    produced by J. Stephen Peace and John DeBello, and directed by John DeBello 
                                    based upon an original idea by Costa Dillon. The screenplay was written by 
                                    Dillon, Peace, and DeBello. The film is a spoof of B movies. Made on a budget 
                                    less than US$100,000, the story involves tomatoes becoming sentient by unknown 
                                    means and revolting against humanity. The success of the film led to three 
                                    sequels, all co-written by the same three writers and directed by DeBello.
