            Beer had more kidney benefits than other alcoholic drinks; 
            each bottle of beer that men consumed daily lowered their 
            risk of developing kidney stones by 40%.

            Researchers in Sapporo, Japan, found that the compound 
            humulone provides an effective guard against a virus that 
            can cause severe forms of pneumonia and bronchitis in 
            children. Someone would have to drink around 30, 12-ounce 
            cans for humulone to have any virus-fighting effect, however. 
            But it's the thought that counts. Bottoms up!
