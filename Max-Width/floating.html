    <h1>ALIEN VS PREDATOR!</h1>

        In deep space, the crew of the commercial starship Nostromo is awakened
        from their cryo-sleep capsules halfway through their journey home to 
        investigate a distress call from an alien vessel. The terror begins 
        when the crew encounters a nest of eggs inside the alien ship. 
        An organism from inside an egg leaps out and attaches itself to one of
        the crew, causing him to fall into a coma.

        A spacecraft flies near Earth and releases an object which enters the 
        atmosphere. Some time later, in a Central American jungle, U.S. Special 
        Operations Forces veteran Major Alan “Dutch” Schaefer and his elite 
        military rescue team — Mac, Billy, Blain, Poncho, and Hawkins — are tasked 
        by their commander with rescuing an official held hostage by insurgents. 
        CIA agent Dillon, a former commando and an old friend of Dutch, is assigned 
        to supervise the team, despite Dutch's objections. The team discovers the 
        wreckage of a helicopter and three skinned corpses, identified by Dutch as 
        Green Berets he knew personally at Fort Bragg.

        In 2004, a Predator mothership arrives in Earth orbit to draw humans to an 
        ancient Predator training ground on Bouvetøya, an island about one thousand
        miles north of Antarctica. A buried pyramid giving off a "heat bloom" 
        attracts a group of explorers led by billionaire and self-taught engineer 
        Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen), the original founder and CEO of 
        Weyland Industries, who unknowingly activates an Alien egg production line 
        as a hibernating Alien Queen is awakened within the pyramid. Three Predators 
        descend unto the planet and enters the structure, killing all humans in their 
        way with the intention of hunting the newly formed Aliens, while the scattered 
        explorers are captured alive by Aliens and implanted with embryos.
