            Bananas in Pyjamas is an Australian children's television series that 
            premiered on 20 July 1992 on ABC. It has since become syndicated in many 
            different countries, and dubbed into other languages. In the United States, 
            the "Pyjamas" in the title was modified to reflect the American spelling pajamas.
