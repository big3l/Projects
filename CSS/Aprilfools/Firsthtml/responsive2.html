        <h2>Important writing</h2>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 
            1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to 
            make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but 
            also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
            It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets 
            containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing 
            software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

        <h3>Advertisment</h3>
        <p>An advert is an advertisement: just shorten advertisement, and you get advert. 
            Of course, as a verb, to advert to something means to refer to it.
